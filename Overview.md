Comparative assisment of mental health of student by using various machine learning algorithm.
This study aims to evaluate the accuracy of six Machine Learning algorithms (Logistic Regression, SVM, Na√Øve Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and KNN) in predicting Mental health problems (depression and anxiety) in the FEAT,DMIHER(DU) university students. The study aims to find out the best model of early identification and intervention through gathering and analyzing demographic details, academic performance, lifestyles and results of mental health screening of the students. The results will help to establish target approaches that will help the students to be out of the negative effects that are as a result of mental health problems. Early identification and intervention are crucial for mitigating the negative impacts of these issues on academic performance, social well-being, and overall quality of life. By analyzing a dataset of 142 student responses to a 20-question survey, encompassing demographic information, academic performance, lifestyle habits, and mental health screening results, we aim to identify the most accurate predictive model This research will contribute to the development of targeted interventions and support services to enhance the mental well-being of university students.
